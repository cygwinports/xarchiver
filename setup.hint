sdesc: "Xfce4 archive manager"
ldesc: "Xarchiver is a Desktop Environment independent archiver 
frontend. All common archive types are supported. RPM and ISO are 
handled without rpm or isodump executables. To run it you only need 
GTK+2 libraries and obviously the various rar, arj and 7z for these 
archives types."
